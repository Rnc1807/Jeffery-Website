     <h1>MY PERSONAL CONNECTION</h1>
    <p>I have skied since i was young first at Happy Valley in whakapapa and then at turoa.<br/> My family goes skiing yearly at turoa and I find it a lot of fun.<br/> Recently I skied at mount hutt t in the south island and it was a blast. <br/>I hope that skiing will not be stopped by global warming so the next generation can experience it.<br/>I also hope that skiing doesn't become too commercialised <br/>otherwise it would take away the special feeling
