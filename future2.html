     <h1>THE FUTURE OF SKIING</h1>
    <p>With global warming there is going to be a lot less snow so this means shorter skiing seasons.<br/> Also with the commercialism of skiing lots of more skilled skiers will go back country to miss the lines.<br/> Just last weekend I went outside with my<br/> dad and brother and there was almost no one there and it felt so much more natural and like a big adventure.<br/>So think this is also a big possible change.Lots of ski resorts are going solar to minimise global warming.<br/>
A ski resort in the USA has gone fully solar and they hope that other resorts see the potential of solar power.<br/> Also i think faster lifts and more accessible mountain roads to get to the ski field
